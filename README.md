# Catagorising-words-using-SVM-and-word2vec

This project shows how a Support Vector Machine can be used to tell if a word is a noun, verb, adverb or adjective.

While this has little to no practical use it is a great demonstration of how word2vec works as it uses a the Continuous Bag of Words Model which creates vectors out of words based 
on their place within a sentence then it makes sense that these catagories would be clusted together. These clusters can be then found using a linear Support Vector Machine.
